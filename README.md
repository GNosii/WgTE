An expansion for PlaceholderAPI that combines WorldGuard and Towny data to provide you with placeholders you might like:
* `wgte_can_pvp`: Can players fight in this area? Returns an boolean. It checks if the area is an Towny wilderness, if it is, it checks for WorldGuard flags, if it isn't, it returns an Towny combat test result.
* `wgte_can_pvp_formatted`: Same as above but returns formatted messages.
